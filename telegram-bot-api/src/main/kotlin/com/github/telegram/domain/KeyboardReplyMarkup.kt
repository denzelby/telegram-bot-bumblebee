/**
 * This object represents a custom keyboard with reply options.
 * 
 * Example: A user requests to change the bot‘s language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard to select the new language. 
 * Other users in the group don’t see the keyboard.
 *
 * @property keyboard List of button rows, each represented by an List of KeyboardButton objects
 * @property resizeKeyboard Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit 
 *           (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of buttons). 
 *           Defaults to false, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the same height as the app's standard keyboard.
 * @property oneTimeKeyboard Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. 
 *           The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual 
 *           letter-keyboard in the chat – the user can press a special button in the input field
 *           to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to false.
 * @property selective Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to specific users only. Targets: 
 *           1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 
 *           2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.
